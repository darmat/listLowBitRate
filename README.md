## Overview

A simple script that searches through a directory structure and writes information
of all the mp3 files that are below 256k bitrate. It lists the artist, title, album, and bitrate.
By default it will use the script files parent directory as the root directory to start the search.
Currently it only supports mp3 files, however, support for other file types could be added easily.
